# 🚀 FastAPI Student API - `expecting_more`

This folder contains a simple FastAPI project for managing student records via RESTful endpoints.

---

## 📚 Description

`myapi.py` defines a FastAPI app that supports CRUD operations on a student database stored in memory. It demonstrates how to build and document APIs using FastAPI.

---

## 🛠️ Techniques

- FastAPI for API creation  
- Pydantic for data validation  
- Path and query parameters  
- Swagger UI for interactive docs  

---

## 🔗 Endpoints

- `GET /` — Root endpoint  
- `GET /get/students/{student_id}` — Get student by ID  
- `GET /get-by-name?name=...` — Get student by name  
- `POST /create-student/{student_id}` — Create a new student  
- `PUT /update-student/{student_id}` — Update student info  
- `DELETE /delete-student/{student_id}` — Delete a student

## 💡 Future Improvements

- Add persistent database (e.g., SQLite or PostgreSQL)  
- Implement authentication  
- Add pagination and filtering  
- Write unit tests for endpoints
